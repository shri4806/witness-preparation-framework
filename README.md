# Witness Preparation Framework for Pre-Trial Analysis

This project proposes an AI-assisted framework to support pre-trial witness preparation in criminal cases.  
The framework analyses unstructured witness testimonies using explainable NLP and rule-based techniques to identify key factual information, statement variations, and potential inconsistencies.

## Problem Statement
Witness preparation in criminal cases is largely manual and time-consuming. Legal practitioners must analyse lengthy witness statements to identify factual details and inconsistencies, which increases the risk of oversight. This framework aims to provide structured analytical support during the pre-trial phase.

## Key Features
- Key information extraction from witness statements  
- Statement variation analysis across multiple testimonies  
- Rule-based inconsistency detection for pre-trial preparation  
- Explainable and human-in-the-loop design  

## Technology Stack
- Python  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
- TF-IDF Vectorisation  
- Cosine Similarity  
- Rule-based Logic  

## Project Status
Initial setup and model development in progress.

## Future Enhancements
- Supervised calibration of similarity thresholds using annotated statement pairs
- Topic classification to assist large-scale comparison
- Interactive user interface for document upload and visualization
